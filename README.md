# descriptives-realpython

Create a new github repo called
‘descriptives-realpython’; 

this repo should contain a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) or py file (.py) that
successfully executes all of the code in the realpython-descriptive stats page:
https://realpython.com/python-statistics/

## of note
I was using python 3.9.1 for this lecture
